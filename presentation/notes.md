# Agent-Based Modelling

## What is Agent-Based Modelling?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model

"An agent-based model (ABM) is a class of computational models for simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous agents (both individual or collective entities such as organizations or groups) with a view to assessing their effects on the system as a whole. It combines elements of game theory, complex systems, emergence, computational sociology, multi-agent systems, and evolutionary programming."


Individual agents are typically characterized as boundedly rational, presumed to be acting in what they perceive as their own interests, such as reproduction, economic benefit, or social status,[4] using heuristics or simple decision-making rules. ABM agents may experience "learning", adaptation, and reproduction.[5]

Most agent-based models are composed of: (1) numerous agents specified at various scales (typically referred to as agent-granularity); (2) decision-making heuristics; (3) learning rules or adaptive processes; (4) an interaction topology; and (5) an environment. ABMs are typically implemented as computer simulations, either as custom software, or via ABM toolkits, and this software can be then used to test how changes in individual behaviors will affect the system's emerging overall behavior.


## History of Agent-Based Modelling
"The idea of agent-based modeling was developed as a relatively simple concept in the late 1940s. Since it requires computation-intensive procedures, it did not become widespread until the 1990s."

### Early Developments

#### Von Neumann Machine

#### John Conway's Game of Life

### First Models (1970s & 1980s)

#### Thomas Schelling's Segregation Model

#### Robert Axelrod's Prisoner's Dilemma Tournament

### Expansion (1990s)

#### Modelling Software: StarLogo, Swarn, NetLogo,

#### Sugarscape (Epstein & Axtell)

#### Textbook: Social Simulation (Gilbert 1999)
