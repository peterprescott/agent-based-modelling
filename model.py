# Make a y variable.

y0 = 50
#~ # test y0 has been assigned correctly

# Make a x variable.

x0 = 50
#~ # test x0 has been assigned correctly
#~ print("x0 = "+str(x0))

# Change y and x based on random numbers.



# Make a second set of y and xs, and make these change randomly as well.
# Work out the distance between the two sets of y and xs.
