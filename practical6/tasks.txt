DONE.--Using the lecture notes, can you write out the environment as a file at the end?

DONE -- Can you make a second file that writes out the total amount stored by all the agents on a line? 

DONE -- Can you get the model to append the data to the file, rather than clearing it each time it runs?

DONE (using __repr__) -- Can you override __str__(self) in the agents, as mentioned in the lecture on classes, so that they display this information information about their location and stores when printed?

DONE -- Can you get the agents to wander around the full environment by finding out the size of environment inside the agents, and using the size when you randomize their starting locations and deal with the boundary conditions?

At the moment, the agents only eat 10 units at a time. This will leave a few units in each area, even if intensly grazed. Can you get them to eat the last few bits, if there's less than 10 left, without leaving negative values?

Can you get the agents to sick up their store in a location if they've been greedy guts and eaten more than 100 units? (note that when you add or subtract from the map, the colours will re-scale).
