# Agent-Based Modelling in Python
A project done as part of [the Data CDT](https://datacdt.org/)'s GEOG5995M/ENVS802 module.

This project is the result of working through [the practical exercises](https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/study/core-python-phd/) put together by [Andy Evans](https://ajevans.github.io/) to teach core programming skills to students starting a four-year integrated PhD and MSc in Data Analytics and Society.

It is 'licensed' under the [The Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/), and available on [my Github](https://github.com/peterprescott/agent-based-modelling). 

It is intended to be [run from the command line](https://www.howtogeek.com/437682/command-lines-why-do-people-still-bother-with-them/), though the project includes the beginnings of a Tkinter GUI, as well as a proof-of-concept of a web-page GUI with code written in JavaScript instead of Python.

You need to have Git and Python installed.

To run, first clone the repository, and navigate into the project folder. You can then run the model straightaway.

```console
git clone https://github.com/peterprescott/agent-based-modelling
cd agent-based-modelling
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run_model.py
```
